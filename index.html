<li> I have selected <b>'Flavors' font</b> from google font.</li>
<li> There is a option in google fonts to add the selected fonts if i add it i can see the code for that font. i can directly add that code into the head of our html.</li>
<li> Then i have added the font family. my font name is Flavors and its type is cursive so i have added my font name and the type into the font family</li>
<li> To add <b>font family</b> i have used style tag. </li>
<li> I have used <b>CSS </b>to insert the font family using style tag. First i have opened the style tag and body then added font family into it and with font name, type and closed it.</li>

<h2> <FONT COLOR= green>Font Serving Strategies for Enhanced Web Design: </h2></font>
<p> serving fonts mainly focuses on Making font files accessible to web browsers so that thay can download and display the specific font on website. while using custom fonts on a website we have to send these font files to the user's browser for processing. we have different types of serving fonts which have different performance.</p>
<ul
list-style-type: square;>
<li> here one more important format is woof (web open font format) we use this font to store the font files first we should store the font file if we want to serve the font.</li>
<li>we should save the file in woff format to do that not only woff we also use other formats like ttf. coming to font requests users web browser sends a request to download the specific font to access it more efficiently next time when they opens our website.</li>
<li> to make it possible we must provide url's. so that they can be downloaded easily.</li>
<li> It is possible to style the font of our choice we have font family and font face which are used to set the customised fonts to particular HTML elements and sometimes it fails to load or access the specific font so we must add fallback fonts these fallback typefaces in your CSS is standard practice.</li>
<li> The browser will make use of these fallback fonts to keep the text readable if the custom font cannot be loaded or is not accessible. An uninterrupted user experience depends on this.</li>
<li> we have different steps to serve a font as discused above first we have to host and store the font files. next process involves specifing file, including css styles after that we get font requests and then we add fallback fonts once all this process is done we go for testing. </li></ul>
